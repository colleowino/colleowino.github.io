I changed a few things.

### Getting started

All you need to do is to install the jekyll gem, Then cd into the directory and run `jekyll serve` and you are good to go.

### Themes 
I am using a variation of two jekyll themes, the first being [hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) and then [tiffany](https://github.com/dubuyuye/blog.git).
The glyphicons in use are [octicons](https://octicons.github.com/) and [font-awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
You can get more themes [here](http://jekyllthemes.org/).
