#### Install git
<code>sudo apt-get install git</code>

#### Setup git
You need to configure you git installation with your username and email. This email is atttached to every commit you make <code> git config --global user.email "youremail@provider.com </code> <code> git config --global user.name "user name" </code>

### Cheat a little
The best way to learn git commands is to use them frequently and a cheat sheet can help with that. Here's a github [repo](https://github.com/arslanbilal/git-cheat-sheet) with one that you can download in pdf
