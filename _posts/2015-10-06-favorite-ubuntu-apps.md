excerpt: After installing ubuntu you need to install your some apps that will make your experience using ubuntu that much better.

#### First things first:
After the initial install you need to give ubuntu a list of software packages and then this list will be reloaded any time you run the apt-get update command.
<code> sudo apt-get update </code>

#### Get restricted extras:
There are some software that ubuntu isn't allowed to include as part of the vanilla install but they do provide the location to download them. Among them audio/video Codecs. Without them you won't be able to play mp3, mp4 and other popular media files. 
To install You need to use apt-get: <code> sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras</code>

### Get Gdebi
I find it annoying to have to open ubuntu software center any time I need to install a .deb package. You can set gdebi as the default .deb package installer.
<code>sudo apt-get install gdebi </code>
