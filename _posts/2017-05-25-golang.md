I have been doing programming challenges using python and ruby on <a href="open.kattis.com/countries/KEN">kattis</a> and feel its time I tried solving them using a new language.
How about <a href="https://golang.org">go lang</a>. I installed it via <a href="https://github.com/moovweb/gvm">gvm</a>
I suppose it is to Go lang what <a href="https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv">rbenv</a> is to ruby.

	zsh < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)

run `gvm version` to confirm it installed correctly, I happen to use <a href="">zsh</a> instead of bash. The script inserts some new lines at the end of `~/.zshrc`. 

	[[ -s "/home/cliff/.gvm/scripts/gvm" ]] && source "/home/cliff/.gvm/scripts/gvm"

Also needed an to install bison 
	
	sudo apt-get install bison

Just like installing ruby using rbenv, the install is a pain in terms of time. It installed go 1.4 pretty quickly but 1.5 calls for a bit of patience. I tried installing go1.5 through gvm and it didn't work so I went for the latest major version when I was writing this.

	gvm install go1.4 -B
	gvm use go1.4
	export GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=$GOROOT
	gvm install go1.8	

##### If all went well. ![go installed](/img/go-installed.png "terminal output after installing go ")

set it as default `gvm use go1.8 --default `

##### Test it out 

	cat > hello.go

paste this code in:

{% highlight golang tabsize=2 %}

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Printf("hello, world\n")
}

{% endhighlight %}
