Ubuntu ships with nautilus as its default file explorer. Its listed as "files" in the program list. The screenshots I have used my explanations may have a different icons and theme different from the default ubuntu theme. On my machine I am using the [arc theme](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) and [moka icons](http://snwh.org/moka/moka-icon-theme/download/)

## Tips

#### Add shortcut to open the files explorer.

After switching over to ubuntu, one of the first things I missed was the ability to open the file explore with the `Win+E` font combination. But its easy to fix. 

- Open system settings
- Select Keyboard, shortcuts tab and launcher Panel.
- Locate and click **Home folder**, then click type the desired keyboard shortcut. In this case the "win" key or super and E. 
- Close The settings dialog and try out the shorcut.

#### Bookmark folders you use often 

When you have the explorer open you can type **`ctrl+D`** and the shortcut will appear belowe the default folders eg Documents and other mounted file-systems.


#### Important shorcuts 

- **`Ctrl+L`** : When you want to copy the directory address.
