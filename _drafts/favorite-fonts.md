The majority of fonts on this list are sans, simply because on web/mobile interfaces people don't often read long text and hence the sans typeface will be the best choice

### Sans-serif:

#### 1. [work-sans](http://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/){:target='_blank'}
If you are looking for something that gives you that magazine vibe this is your font

#### 2. [montserrat](http://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/){:target='_blank'} [homepage](http://montserrat.zkysky.com.ar/en){: class="sub"}
This font literally looks like Helvetica but with a twist, Its characters are wider.

#### 3. [Source sans pro](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro){:target='_blank'} [homepage](http://blog.typekit.com/2012/08/02/source-sans-pro/){: class="sub"}
If you are doing anything to do with code then this would be your best way to keep people
within that context even when they are not looking at code. Its sister font being "source code pro".
Looks a lot like `Whitney A` typeface

#### 4. [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/#download){:target='_blank'} [homepage](http://www.latofonts.com/){: class="sub"}
It looks rather rounded but its fine. similar to `proxima nova`

#### 5. [open sans](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans){:target='_blank'} 
This was a font that I thought was the natural successor to Helvetica and Arial.

#### 6. [Roboto](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto){:target='_blank'} 
I fell in love with this font when they shipped this with android.
