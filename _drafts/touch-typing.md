Install stamina [stamina](http://typingsoft.com/download.htm)
It has some cool features:
	 - Your own code, 
	 - My own settings: cencor, set the text to 100.

- Keep a record , sample of what I did
- the key's that were hard to master
- If you are fairly good use type [typing.io](https://typing.io/)
