excerpt: "When I was learning how to code I struggled to grasp the concepts but I feel that now I can better explain how code works independent of
a specific programming language"

- start with the basics: try running javascript 
- why: You don't have to go with the types provided 
- Learning code:
	- its not natural, you understand by doing and making assumptions, it will be hard
	- algebra, creative, solve it from first principles 
	- palindrome
	- store the values

- Logic: if, else, conditions
- looping: for each, while that's true. infenite loop.
